# SN_CICD_Pipeline
CI/CD implementation

CICD Server Component

CICD V3 needs this Update-Set to be installed to work.

To convert this to run under your company namespace run
gulp namespace --name your-name-space


Please note: the namespace must also be set in the CICD_APP_PREFIX env variable (in .env in the sn-cicd project)
